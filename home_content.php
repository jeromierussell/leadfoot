		This is the home page...  where West can have some daily ramblings!<br>
		<p>This is the first paragraph. It will contain a bunch of text so that it 
		wraps down to some new lines, this will test the appearance of the page_content
		section when the data to fill it is longer than one line. We'd like to
		ensure that it has a nice look to it.</p>
		<p>This second paragraph is just more of the same. Same as the first that
		is. Since we're just killing space, how about a quote? "Now is the time
		for all great men, to come to the aid of their country!" That's a good one.
		I really like it.</p>
