		<p>NOTE: This fantasy league is based on the 36 points paying races only. The Duel 125's,
Budweiser Shootout and Lowes All Star Race are all considered "off" weeks.</p>
		
		<h1>The General Rules (quick glance)</h1>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p>
			Each member picks one driver (team) per week. No two people may ever have the same driver
in the same race. You may pick the same driver as much as possible throughout the year willing
he hasn't been picked before it's your turn. No two league members may ever "trade" drivers for
whatever reason.
		</p>
		<p>
			The picking order for the Daytona 500 will be decided by random draw. The drawing will be
			held at the NASCAR League kickoff party which will be held on the same night as the Bud
			Shootout in early February. If you are unavailable to attend the party the Commish will draw
			at random for you while other league members are present. Each week I will make a call/text
			letting you know it's your pick. The website will provide which drivers have already been taken
			and which are available. We will make an attempt to choose our Daytona 500 drivers the night of
			the party. If you cannot attend the party please prepare by giving myself or someone you know in
			the league a list of your tops picks. If you are not present we will select the top driver on your list
			that has yet to be chosen. I will also try to call you if need be. (There is a possibility the picks for
			the Daytona 500 will not be completed the night of the League kickoff party due to the absence
			of a member, if this happens the picks will be completed over the phone or web as usual)
		</p>
		<p>
			The picking order thereafter will be determined by inverting the finishing order of the previous
			race.
		</p>

		<h2>Yearly League Fees</h2>
		<p>
		League fees are $10 per week. All players must pay $60 prior to the drawing for picking order
for the Daytona 500. This will cover the first six weeks of the season. An example: I pay $60 the
kickoff party. Now my first s races are covered. I finish 2nd the first week ($10 win) and on the
second week win the race ($50 win). My account online would show being paid through the first
12 weeks now instead of the first six.
		</p>
		<p>
Any player that is not paid to the current week will pick last. If you don't want to risk it, YOU
BETTER PAY WELL IN ADVANCE!!!
		</p>

		<h2>Yearly Payouts /Winnings</h2>
		<p>
Payouts will be credited towards player's weekly fees until the season is paid in full. All
winnings beyond the season dues will be credited to your account for future payout. <span style="text-decoration:underline">NO</span> payouts
for season winnings will be made until the awards party after the close of the season. Again, <span style="text-decoration:underline">NO</span>
money will be distributed during the season. This makes it easier on everyone plus I don't have
to keep up with figuring out where to meet who each week. I will track all winnings and money
owed on the website which everyone will be able to view. Trust me to the winners, this will be
very helpful come end of November (Christmas time).
		</p>

		<p>
All money paid in and all money won will be tracked by our league website. At any time each
member can log into his account and see where they stand in terms of winnings / debts.
		</p>

		<h2>Picking a Team</h2>

		<p>
Remember we are picking a team, not a driver. If for some reason (illness, emergency,
etc..) your driver has to get out of the seat for a race. You will receive however many points
your "team" for that week receive regardless of whom is driving the car. Example: If I pick Brian
Vickers for Watkins Glen and after qualifying they decide to put Boris Said in the car, I still
receive however many points that car receives regardless of who the driver is.
		</p>

		<p>
If a car / team is picked that does not qualify for the race, that league member will receive zero
points for the week and will have first pick the next week.
		</p>

		<p>
Once the Commish or website has notified you that it is your pick, please do your best to pick
as soon as possible. We have 26 members with 26 different schedules in the league. Even if I
wanted to there is no way of setting a "schedule" timed picking order each week. It just can't be
done. I'm not going to hold someone responsible for not picking in two hours if he's working
nightshift and is asleep in the middle of the day and it's his pick. Please also understand that it is
my responsibility to get in 26 picks in 3-1/2 days so if it's your pick...PICK!!! Nascar doesn't
finalize race results until around Monday at noon CMT. After the results are finalized our
league points will be updated. That gives me from Monday at noon until Friday morning before
practice to get all members picks in, please do your best to try to help me by making your pick in
a timely fashion. If you need more time for whatever reason the Commish reserves the right to
award a player extra time to pick in order to keep the league reasonable. Do NOT ask for more
time just for the hell of it. Also don't make the mistake of thinking just because it's early in the
week "we've got plenty of time". Just please make your pick asap because someone else down
the line may need that extra time depending on what shift they are working. Also next week you
may be the one needing that extra time.
		</p>

		<p>
In the event that the Commish believes that someone is jeopardizing the picks for the week being
totally completed; the Commish reserves the right to assign a member the highest driver in Sprint
Cup points that has yet to be picked.
		</p>

		<p>
If a race is postponed and another race is run before the postponed race, all picks for the
postponed race are scratched. The same picking order will be used for the following race.
		</p>

<p>
Weekly payouts will be $30 for first & $10 for second. Payouts are based on finishing 1st &
2nd <span style="text-decoration:underline">in the league</span>; YOUR CAR DOES NOT HAVE TO WIN THE RACE TO GET THE $30
PAYOUT.
</p>

		<p>
There will be an additional $20 per week awarded if your car wins the race. If no one picks the
winning car that week, the pot will carry over to the next race.
		</p>

		<p>
The player with the highest number of Bud Poles at the end of the season will get the Pole Pot.
If there is a tie, the player with the highest season points will win. <span style="text-decoration:underline">If drivers are lined up based
on owner's points due to qualifying being canceled / rainout, the Bud Pole will not count towards
the League's 'Most Bud Poles' award.</span>
		</p>

		<h2>Leadfoot Points System</h2>
		<p>
            Season points are awarded based on the Sprint Cup points awarded to the chosen team each
            week. Each member will be awarded the same number of points the team receives for the
            week. If for some reason a member's driver is substituted for due to illness or emergency, the
            member will receive the amount of Sprint Cup points whomever subs for their driver receives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to the current scoring system in the Sprint Cup Series, a driver may only score points in
            one professional series. A driver that runs in the Nationwide Series for a championship receives
            zero points when running in a Sprint Cup race. We will enforce this rule in the Leadfoot Racing
            League. If you pick a driver that is racing for a championship in another Nascar sanctioned
            series, they as well as the league member will receive zero points for the week. The driver can
            however can still score the win and the member will also receive a Leadfoot Racing win (counts
            towards season wins and money). The driver also can score a poll which would be reflected
            in our league to the member. However no points will be awarded to the driver or our league
            member unless rules made by the 2012 Nascar board are amended mid season. See example
            below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Example: In 2012 Ricky Stenhouse (running for Nationwide Championship) is selected at
            Charlotte by a member of our league. The league member can still get a pole win for the week.
            The member can still get a win and receive the weekly payout for the league. The member
            does not however receive any points being as the driver gets 0 Sprint Cup driver points for the
            week. Receiving 0 points does not in any shape or form affect the picking order next week.
        </p>
        <p>
            Exceptions to the Rule:<br/>
            If you pick a team in which for some reason must have a driver sub. You will still receive the
            driver points your team earns for the week. See example below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Example: In 2012 at Daytona AJ Allmendinger fails his drug test and is yanked from the #22
            car before the race. Sam Hornish Jr. is selected to replace Allmendinger. Hornish is however
            running for a Nationwide Championship so he receives 0 Sprint Cup points. Being as the
            league member originally selected a driver that was scheduled to receive Sprint Cup points,
            the member will receive however many points the car / team would receive depending on the
            finishing position. As of the moment, this is the only way any league member can gain points
            when having a driver that isn't racing for Sprint Cup driver points. Poles and wins are also
            received if the substitute drivers happens to win either.
        </p>
        <p>
            The highest total at the end of the season is the winner. In the instance of any ties in points
            the player with the most wins on the season trumps. In the event of a tie in points and wins the
            player with the most top 5's wins. In the event all three of these categories tie, the tie is broken
            by proceeding down the line - top 10's, top 15's, top 20's. There is no "Chase" or playoff system
            in this league.
        </p>

		<h2>League Penalties</h2>
		<p>
If a driver/car is penalized points by NASCAR for an infraction which occurred <span style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold">after the start</span>
of the race, the player who had that driver will lose the same amount of points. Penalties for
infractions which occurred <span style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold">prior to the start</span> of the race will not be assessed within the league.
You will be awarded the EXACT same amount of points as your team. * If Kyle Busch loses 25
driver points after the race due to unapproved spoiler, you lose those 25 also. If Dale Jr. curses
after the race to a reporter and is fined Tuesday 25 points, tough luck, you just got fined too. If
Jimmie Johnson is penalized 50 points for an unapproved spoiler in practice on Friday before
the race and is handed out a penalty Tuesday, this fine does not apply to the member being as it
was <span style="font-weight:bold">before</span> the green flag. Owner points / penalties are irrelevant. So let me reiterate one more
time to be clear: Any penalties BEFORE the green flag waves are irrelevant. Any penalties for
unapproved activities AFTER the green flag waves are totaled.
		</p>

		<h2>Revising Picks</h2>
		<p>
It is each player's responsibility to check the website by 8:00 PM each Friday evening prior
to a race to ensure that their pick has been recorded properly. Picks will be revised only if the
mistake is caught BEFORE 8:00 pm on Friday. You may not change your pick just because
you "changed your mind". The website will warn you when you select a driver that has to
qualify. In the event that somehow, someway, someone selects the wrong driver and even
verifies the wrong driver and makes the pick anyway (it has happened yes) - The Commish
reserves the right to revise the members pick <span style="text-decoration:underline">only and if only</span> the member contacts me by phone
immediately after the pick is made. <span style="text-decoration:underline">This must be done immediately</span>; if you call me 15 minutes
later, sorry...you got who you got.
		</p>

		<h2>Yearly Webmaster & Commish Fees</h2>
		<p>
There are (3) yearly personal fees pulled from our prize pool. One fee being $180 per year to
me for covering all stats, keeping up with news, entering picks and calling people as needed to
enter picks each week, settle disputes & just overall time spent on the league and keeping up
with money and balances.
		</p>

		<p>
(2) Other league fees are donated by we the league (not requested by them). I will donate $180
each year to Andy & Jeromie for webmaster services and webpage programming fees. These
guys are the brains behind the operations. These guys are the ones that make sure all of the
points and math adds up each week. These guys give us sorted stats, driver averages and make
sure the driver pick pages work correctly each week. These guys are the reason the entire
website runs so smoothly on my end and believe you me it's much more complicated behind
the scenes than anything we see on just the leader board each week. These guys did not request
to be paid but I refuse to let them spend hours upon hours for no fee. Believe me when I say
$180 to each of them for the year is a steal compared to what they should be getting and I thank
them for their services. If you have a problem with any of these fees, (and please don't take this
the wrong way because I appreciated every member) it's pretty simple...I could care less, find
another league to play in. I don't want to hear any complaining because at the end of the year it
totals to about .50 cents / hour. I'm betting none of us work that cheap.
		</p>

		<h2>League Payouts Date</h2>

		<p>
The NASCAR League awards party will be held on or around the night of the NASCAR Nextel
Cup awards banquet. (Usually on Friday, one week after Thanksgiving.) Sometimes we will
have it at a member's house, other times it's at a restaurant. All payouts will be distributed then
in cash to each member.
		</p>

		<p>
In the event of an "issue" arising dealing with the handling of points or rules. The Commish
reserves the right to put it to a vote with league members and the majority rules. (Just in case)
		</p>

		<p>
Please understand this league could cost you up to $360 for the entire year. Also remember all
winnings will be applied to your league account until the end of the season.
